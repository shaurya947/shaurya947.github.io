			<p>
			Presently, I am seeking a technical role in the <strong>gaming / music software</strong> industry that begins in Summer 2016.
			</p>

			<p>
			Over the last 3 - 4 years, I have experimented a fair amount in my field. But now I feel that the job I take up must be related to one of <strong>my passions</strong>, which is either gaming or music. I have been an avid gamer all my life, and have taken up some projects / courses during college where I was either working on a game or studying a technology that is used in developing games.
			</p>

			<p>
			I have also been <strong>playing drums</strong> since I was 12, and I upload covers to my YouTube channel from time to time. In the process of making these covers, I have come across a few editing / production applications. Moreover, popular applications such as Pandora, Spotify and Jukely are also very interesting to me. 
			</p>

			<p>
			Now, I wish to be the one on the other end, providing a delightful experience to the user. I am a quick learner and a go-getter, and I like to get very good at what I pick up. Learning new things keeps me going. That is why I am also <strong>open to consulting</strong>.
			</p>
