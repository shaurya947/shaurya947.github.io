			<p>
				Presently, I am seeking a Software Developer / Engineer role where I can work on interactive and intuitive end-user applications using cutting-edge tools and technologies.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have worked both at large corporations as well as at small, 10-15 people companies. I am experienced not only in general <b>application development</b>, but also in <b>web development</b> (front-end and back-end), <b>Android development</b> (using both Java and RubyMotion), and <b>big data</b> technologies.
			</p>
			<p>
				At this stage, I wish to be at a place that is growing and evolving rapidly: where work is challenging and collaborative, and people are excited about what they are building, and where I can take ownership of my own work and grow just as much. I am a quick-learner and a go-getter, and I like to get very good at what I pick up. 
			</p>
