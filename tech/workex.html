			<h4 class="boldTxt pageTxt">Microsoft Corporation, May 2014 - August 2014</h4>
			
			<p>
			I was a PM (Program Manager) Intern on the .NET Ecosystem Team at Microsoft during Summer 2014. See what I was up to:
			<div class="text-center" id="MS-Internship-video"></div>
			</p>
			
			<p>I mainly worked on the following two projects:
			<ol>
				<li class="pLi"><p>The architecture of the .NET framework going forward-there is a great desire to componentize the .NET framework efficiently so that chunks of the framework can exist and be shipped independently. This also makes the framework more "open source". I created a spec for this feature containing a high-level design. I also extensively interacted with colleagues across Developer Division, and enabled my team to communicate with other relevant teams.</li>
				<li class="pLi"><p>.NET Feature Catalog Website-this is a website of all the features in major releases of the .NET framework (all the way from 1.0). Initially, I collaborated with feature owners to design icons for their features, and later towards the end of my internship, I put together the Feature Catalog website. See it <a href="http://microsoft.github.io/dotnetfeatures/">here</a>!</li>
			</ol>

			<h3 class="boldTxt pageTxt" style="margin-top: 0px">Math and Physics Tutor</h3>
			<h4 class="boldTxt pageTxt">UT Dallas Math Lab, January 2013 - Present</h4>
			
			<p>Since January 2013, I've been a Math and Physics tutor at the Math Lab at my University. I assist students of all levels on various Physics and Math university courses on a walk-in basis. Sometimes, I also hold reviews for exams.</p>
			<p>On a typical day, I can usually attend to about 5-8 students in an hour. Interactions with students range from confirming the application of a law to a particular problem, to discussing chapters, proofs, derivations etc. Being able to communicate a particular way of thinking to somebody is very rewarding to me.</p>
			<p>See more about what we do at the Math Lab <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/studentsuccess/mathlab/">here</a>.

			<h3 class="boldTxt pageTxt" style="margin-top: 0px">Voluntary Web Developer</h3>
			<h4 class="boldTxt pageTxt">CG3I Web Dev Team, UT Dallas, May 2013 - June 2013</h4>
			
			<p>In this voluntary project, I got together with a few other students at my University to develop a website for a research group (CG3I) at UT Dallas. The website was to be collaborative, similar to a student college portal, where researchers could store and share information, communicate through discussions and messages, and track project progress.</p>
			<p>I worked with Drupal (a CMS-Content Management System) to build the website with my colleagues. We extensively used open-source modules and also wrote some of our own. A CMS was chosen since we did not have enough time on hand to implement the website from scratch.</p>
