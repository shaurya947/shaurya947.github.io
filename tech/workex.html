			<!-- TribalScale experience -->
			
			<h3 class="boldTxt pageTxt" style="margin-top: 0px">Software Developer</h3>
			<h4 class="boldTxt pageTxt">TribalScale, Feb 2018 - Present</h4>
			
			<p>As the Android platform anchor (lead) at TribalScale, I ensure that we are a best-in-class Android shop. I conduct learning sessions on the latest frameworks, support projects, and contribute to the Android community, both internal and external, through documentation and blog posts. Previously, I was leading the development of the Carnival HUB App for Android. I developed new features in Kotlin using RxJava, Koin and Coroutines. I also test-drove most of this development using JUnit, Mockito and Robolectric.

			<!-- Twitter experience -->
			
			<h3 class="boldTxt pageTxt" style="margin-top: 0px">Software Engineer</h3>
			<h4 class="boldTxt pageTxt">Twitter, October 2016 - Feb 2018</h4>
			
			<p>At Twitter, I was part of the Android foundation team, supporting feature teams with their UI and UX needs. I led the effort to standardize font sizes throughout the Android app, which was substantial given the size of the codebase and the number of people actively contributing to it. I developed the Avatar Badging feature, a handy numeric indicator for other accounts in the navigation drawer signifying the number of unread notifications for those accounts. I also developed the Automatic Night Mode feature in the Twitter Android app, and contributed extensively to the big Twitter visual redesign of 2017.

			<h3 class="boldTxt pageTxt" style="margin-top: 0px">Web Developer Intern</h3>
			<h4 class="boldTxt pageTxt">Call-Em-All, August 2015 - December 2015</h4>
			
			<p>As a Web Developer Intern at Call-Em-All, I worked on <a href="http://material-ui.com/#/">Material-UI</a>, the company's open-source project that combines Facebook's React Framework with Google's Material Design.
			</p>

			<p>Material-UI (MUI) is a continously evolving project. During my internship, I was a collaborator for MUI. I contributed to its API and documentation, and released v0.12.x to v0.14.x. I also deployed a Node app using Heroku and AWS that generates custom on-demand builds of MUI -- similar to a CDN.
			</p>

			<p>In addition to my work on MUI, I also worked on a full-stack web application using React, Redux, Restify, Mongoose and Bluebird (Promises).

			<!-- epic experience -->

			<h3 class="boldTxt pageTxt" style="margin-top: 0px">Software Developer Intern</h3>
			<h4 class="boldTxt pageTxt">Epic Systems Corporation, June 2015 - August 2015</h4>
			
			<p>
			At Epic, I designed and developed a new feature from the ground up. This feature helps doctors and clinicians to customize their reports to specific patients and scenarios, on-the-fly.
			</p>

			<p>
			I worked on two of the company's main-line products, namely Epic Monitor and Hyperspace. To develop this feature, I used Microsoft's .NET technologies and a custom JavaScript framework. Throughout the process, I collaborated with UX designers and conducted usability testing in short feedback-driven iterations.

			<h3 class="boldTxt pageTxt" style="margin-top: 0px">Program Manager Intern</h3>
			<h4 class="boldTxt pageTxt">Microsoft Corporation, May 2014 - August 2014</h4>
			
			<p>
			I was a PM (Program Manager) Intern on the .NET Ecosystem Team at Microsoft during Summer 2014. See what I was up to:
			</p>
			<div class="text-center embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9" id="MS-Internship-video"></div>
			<br>
			
			<p>I mainly worked on the following two projects:
			<ol>
				<li class="pLi"><p>The architecture of the .NET framework going forward-there is a great desire to componentize the .NET framework efficiently so that chunks of the framework can exist and be shipped independently. This also makes the framework more "open source". I created a spec for this feature containing a high-level design. I also extensively interacted with colleagues across Developer Division, and enabled my team to communicate with other relevant teams.</li>
				<li class="pLi"><p>.NET Feature Catalog Website-this is a website of all the features in major releases of the .NET framework (all the way from 1.0). Initially, I collaborated with feature owners to design icons for their features, and later towards the end of my internship, I put together the Feature Catalog website. I built the website using BootStrap, jQuery and marked (a JavaScript library to parse Markdown). jQuery was used heavily for parsing JSON data. 
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3 class="boldTxt pageTxt" style="margin-top: 0px">Math and Physics Tutor</h3>
			<h4 class="boldTxt pageTxt">UT Dallas Math Lab, January 2013 - May 2015</h4>
			
			<p>For over 2 years, I was a Math and Physics tutor at the Math Lab at my University. I assisted students of all levels on various Physics and Math university courses on a walk-in basis. Sometimes, I also conducted reviews for exams.</p>
			<p>On a typical day, I usually attended to about 5-8 students in an hour. Interactions with students ranged from confirming the application of a law to a particular problem, to discussing chapters, proofs, derivations etc. Being able to communicate a particular way of thinking to somebody has always been very rewarding to me.</p>

			<h3 class="boldTxt pageTxt" style="margin-top: 0px">Voluntary Web Developer</h3>
			<h4 class="boldTxt pageTxt">CG3I Web Dev Team, UT Dallas, May 2013 - June 2013</h4>
			
			<p>In this voluntary project, I got together with a few other students at my University to develop a website for a research group (CG3I) at UT Dallas. The website was to be collaborative, similar to a student college portal, where researchers could store and share information, communicate through discussions and messages, and track project progress.</p>
			<p>I worked with Drupal (a CMS-Content Management System) to build the website with my colleagues. We extensively used open-source modules and also wrote some of our own. A CMS was chosen since we did not have enough time on hand to implement the website from scratch.</p>
