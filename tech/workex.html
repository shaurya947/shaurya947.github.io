			<h3 class="boldTxt pageTxt" style="margin-top: 0px">Web Developer Intern</h3>
			<h4 class="boldTxt pageTxt">Call-Em-All, August 2015 - December 2015</h4>
			
			<p>As a Web Developer Intern at Call-Em-All, I worked on <a href="http://material-ui.com/#/">Material-UI</a>, the company's open-source project that combines Facebook's React Framework with Google's Material Design.
			</p>

			<p>
			Material-UI is a continously evolving project. I contributed to the API and improved the documentation, making it easier for developers to pick up and start using material-ui components. I used cutting-edge JS tools and frameworks such as React, Node, and Webpack.

			<h3 class="boldTxt pageTxt" style="margin-top: 0px">Software Developer Intern</h3>
			<h4 class="boldTxt pageTxt">Epic Systems Corporation, June 2015 - August 2015</h4>
			
			<p>
			At Epic, I designed a developed a new feature from the ground up. This feature helps doctors and clinicians to customize their reports to specific patients and scenarios, on-the-fly.
			</p>

			<p>
			I worked on two of the company's main-line products, namely Epic Monitor and Hyperspace. To develop this feature, I used Microsoft's .NET technologies and a custom JavaScript framework. Throughout the process, I collaborated with UX designers and conducted usability testing in short feedback-driven iterations.

			<h3 class="boldTxt pageTxt" style="margin-top: 0px">Program Manager Intern</h3>
			<h4 class="boldTxt pageTxt">Microsoft Corporation, May 2014 - August 2014</h4>
			
			<p>
			I was a PM (Program Manager) Intern on the .NET Ecosystem Team at Microsoft during Summer 2014. See what I was up to:
			<div class="text-center" id="MS-Internship-video"></div>
			</p>
			
			<p>I mainly worked on the following two projects:
			<ol>
				<li class="pLi"><p>The architecture of the .NET framework going forward-there is a great desire to componentize the .NET framework efficiently so that chunks of the framework can exist and be shipped independently. This also makes the framework more "open source". I created a spec for this feature containing a high-level design. I also extensively interacted with colleagues across Developer Division, and enabled my team to communicate with other relevant teams.</li>
				<li class="pLi"><p>.NET Feature Catalog Website-this is a website of all the features in major releases of the .NET framework (all the way from 1.0). Initially, I collaborated with feature owners to design icons for their features, and later towards the end of my internship, I put together the Feature Catalog website. I built the website using BootStrap, jQuery and marked (a JavaScript library to parse Markdown). jQuery was used heavily for parsing JSON data. 
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3 class="boldTxt pageTxt" style="margin-top: 0px">Math and Physics Tutor</h3>
			<h4 class="boldTxt pageTxt">UT Dallas Math Lab, January 2013 - May 2015</h4>
			
			<p>For over 2 years, I was a Math and Physics tutor at the Math Lab at my University. I assisted students of all levels on various Physics and Math university courses on a walk-in basis. Sometimes, I also conducted reviews for exams.</p>
			<p>On a typical day, I usually attended to about 5-8 students in an hour. Interactions with students ranged from confirming the application of a law to a particular problem, to discussing chapters, proofs, derivations etc. Being able to communicate a particular way of thinking to somebody has always been very rewarding to me.</p>

			<h3 class="boldTxt pageTxt" style="margin-top: 0px">Voluntary Web Developer</h3>
			<h4 class="boldTxt pageTxt">CG3I Web Dev Team, UT Dallas, May 2013 - June 2013</h4>
			
			<p>In this voluntary project, I got together with a few other students at my University to develop a website for a research group (CG3I) at UT Dallas. The website was to be collaborative, similar to a student college portal, where researchers could store and share information, communicate through discussions and messages, and track project progress.</p>
			<p>I worked with Drupal (a CMS-Content Management System) to build the website with my colleagues. We extensively used open-source modules and also wrote some of our own. A CMS was chosen since we did not have enough time on hand to implement the website from scratch.</p>
